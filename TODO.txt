Geo.clj To do list
===================

Geometries
----------

* Geometries should know about their projections
* Geometries should be able to be rendered.

Style
------

* Style api. it should be easy to create geotools style objects.
* gt-css. It would be great to have David's gt-css project. That
  requires including scala as in your project.
