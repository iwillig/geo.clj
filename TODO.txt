* should have everything implement geotools interfaces as much as possible, so then we can reuse those same objects instead of converting back and forth
  - read-features could return something that implements featurecollection
  - can create impl module that creates these wrapping feature collections based on use cases
  - macro where body has seq of features and return gets wrapped back into a lazy feature collection
  - have individual features also implement gis feature interface? 
* macro to auto close feature collection that has been read in
  - then can create a wrapper macro around that that reads and closes feature collection
* need to have additional wrappers to easily create features/collections from different scenarios
